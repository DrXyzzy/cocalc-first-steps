# Welcome to CoCalc!

CoCalc is an online service for running interactive calculations via your web-browser.
There is no need to setup anything locally and you can work from any compute world wide.

Additionally, you can share your projects with collaborators and view and edit your files together.
You can even open up a chat on the side of each file to discuss any details online.

CoCalc supports several document formats for interactive online computations:

## SageMath Worksheets (`*.sagews`)

**Click here to open the [companion SageMath Worksheet](sage_worksheet.sagews)**

...

## Jupyter Notebooks (`*.ipynb`)

**Click here to open the [companion Jupyter Notebook](jupyter_notebook.ipynb)**

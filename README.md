# Welcome to CoCalc!

CoCalc is an online service for running interactive calculations via your web-browser.
There is no need to setup anything locally and you can work from any compute world wide.

Additionally, you can share your projects with collaborators and view and edit your files together.
You can even open up a chat on the side of each file to discuss any details online.

CoCalc supports several document formats for interactive online computations:

## SageMath Worksheets -- `*.sagews`

**Click here to open the [companion SageMath Worksheet](sage_worksheet.sagews)**

...

## Jupyter Notebooks -- `*.ipynb`

**Click here to open the [companion Jupyter Notebook](jupyter_notebook.ipynb)**

[Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) are an emerging format for sharing scientific calculations in a standardized document.
Their key idea is to enable the user to talk to the computer via interactive questions and answers and record the input and output.
On the backend, you can select the engine to talk to (called "kernel").
CoCalc supports:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) -- version 2 and 3.
* [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/)
* [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)  -- [Tutorial](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/index.html)
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
* [R](https://cran.r-project.org)  -- [kickstart](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Lemon-kickstart/)
* [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)
* and many  more ...

There are two ways to use them:

### CoCalc Jupyter

This is a unique implementation of Jupyter on top of the CoCalc platform.
It offers collaboration, chat, details revision history, offline capture of results and a faster interface.

### Classical Jupyter

This is an enhanced version of the classical Jupyter Notebook,
which offers all original functionalities while there are a few technical drawbacks.
Use it when you require full support of the legacy system.

## LaTeX Documents -- `.tex` or `.Rnw`

**Click here to open the [companion LaTeX document](jupyter_notebook.ipynb)**

[LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a sophisticated language for typesetting documents.
CoCalc offers an advanced side-by-side editor with a preview of your work
and foward/inverse search to help you navigate around.
It also supports running embedded calculations using [SageTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/sagetex)
and [Rnw/Knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/minimal/) for R.

## Teaching with CoCalc

There is one more thing.
A course management feature makes it easy to setup a class, hand out worksheets as assignments, collect, grade and redistribute them.
You no longer have to deal with setting up the computers of your students or maintaining a setup in a dedicated lab.
